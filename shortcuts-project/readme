To use this extension:
- you must copy only the init.js and the manifest.json in a folder. Then that extension(folder) must be uploaded inside your browser. (This step must be done only once)
- on any web page press ctrl+alt to show the shortcuts and press ctrl+alt again if you want to hide them.

Enjoy :)
